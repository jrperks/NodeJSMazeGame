  <div id="test">Websocket Maze</div>
<p>In this game, the objective is to escape from the maze with the help of three friends.
The pathway is blocked by several gates which are triggered by switches. However, the
switches in your maze will trigger the gates in the maze of one of your friends, and the
switches of one of your other friends will trigger the gates for your maze. In order
to escape, you all must work together to open each other's gates to proceed further.</p>

<p>You move your player, the 'x' symbol on the map, using the four buttons below the map.
Each button corresponds to a direction, and they are all labelled in the order up, down,
left, right. # symbols are walls, which are unpassable, and _ symbols are floors, which
are open. T symbols are gates which are initially unpassable, but once triggered by switches
they turn into _ symbols and can then be walked on. The o symbol is a switch. Finally,
the % symbol is the exit of the maze. Once a player reaches the exit, everyone else
will be notified. When everyone reaches the exit, you win!</p>
